# Product Guidelines

## Design Principles
- **Minimalist Self-Explanation:** The interface must be entirely self-explanatory through visual cues and hierarchy, minimizing the need for instructional text.
- **Strict Geometric Grid:** All layouts, timeline markers, and spacing must adhere to a rigid, intentional grid system to reinforce the architectural precision of the tool.
- **High-Contrast Visual Hierarchy:** Use high-contrast color accents (Emerald, Red, Blue) and variations in size and weight to prioritize the most critical data, such as the "Golden Hour" meeting overlap.

## Interaction Guidelines
- **Zero-Latency Response:** All interactions, especially the 15-minute snapped scrubber, must provide instantaneous visual feedback to eliminate friction.
- **Contextual Visualization:** Prioritize localized context at the point of interaction (e.g., individual row labels during hover) to maintain focus and prevent cognitive overload.

## Behavioral Standards
- **Precision by Default:** Accuracy is the highest priority. All data visualizations must be mathematically exact and synchronized to real-time UTC.
- **Respectful Scheduling:** The system should naturally guide users toward windows that respect the established business hours of all team members.
